# Burger

## Overview

This application allows users to eat and create burgers!

A user can choose to "devour" an existing burger or create their own if they don't see one to their liking. By typing in the name of a new burger and hitting the "Submit" button, the new burger will appear in the "Hot and Ready" list, ready to be devoured.

Once a burger has been devoured, it will appear in the "Devoured" list to the right.
